# lnverse-Random-Undersampling-for-Class-imbalence-problem
Research project that makes use of fraudulent german credit data to resolve class imbalance problems using IRUS (Inverse Random Undersampling) Algorithm. Through optimization, the algorithm was able to balance out occurrences of different classes in the dataset. Improved accuracy from 80% to 95%
